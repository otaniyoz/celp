# Image processing library in C #

This is a personal collection of image processing tools written in C.
So, you, probably, don't want to use it.

It can do basic image manipulation like conversion from RGB to HSV, or more complex stuff like extended difference of gaussians. But, you, probably, don't want to use it.

No, really, do not use it.
